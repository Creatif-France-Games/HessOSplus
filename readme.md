# HessOS

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowser-2077/HessOS/refs/heads/main/github/V2.png)

HessOS is a lightweight, custom command-line operating system simulator written in Python.  
Designed for learning, tinkering, and fun, HessOS offers a simple shell with essential commands, boot animation, dependency management, and more.

## Features

- **Custom Shell Interface** with command prompt and dynamic command handling
- **Boot Sequence** with centered logo and loading animation  
- **First Boot Dependency Installation** with automatic package setup  
- **Command Modules** for easy extensibility (commands live in `cmds/` folder)  
- Common Unix-like commands:  
  - `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `rm`, `touch`, `cat`, `head`  
  - `clear`, `help`, `ping`, `ssh`, `download`  
- **Logging and Configuration Management** through `logs/` and `config/` folders  
- Shutdown command with fake service loading animation  
- Modular codebase structured with `cmds/`, `startup/`, `utils/`, `config/`, and `logs/`

### Uninstall a package


  
  Usage : ```package uninstall <package_name>```

  Make sure to execute : ```reload-cmds``` to properly uninstall it.

### Add your own package


  You can code your own package and open a pull request with your package informations, code, and dependencies
  I will review it and add it to the "OS"

  Make sure to code it in python (Python 3 and older only)

  Requirements to add your package
